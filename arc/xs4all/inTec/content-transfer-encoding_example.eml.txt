Subject: Let text/plain flow with Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Date: Thu, 27 Sep 2001 00:12:29 +0200
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain;
	charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

And that is bad, because I determine the width of my =
window/message. And not necessary as well. If the client would use the =
MIME header Content-Transfer-Encoding with as value quoted-printable, the=
 text would flow like hell
