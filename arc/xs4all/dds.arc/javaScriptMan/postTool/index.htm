<h2>postTool</h2>
<p>When developing and testing ASP-pages, I thought it would be handy to
easily <em>generate</em> HTTP-Requests with a POST body.
Just take a form, fill out the parameters and their values of the to-be-tested ASP-page. 
Very easy for those hard or impossible to reproduce cases, like an ordernumber which
doesn't exist.<br><br>
The result is postTool.htm. I also made a tool to check which parameters a page submits. 
This one is called postTool.asp.<br><br>
Just as a spin-off, I made saveForm, which saves the values of the inputs of a form to 
a cookie and gets 'em back. This can easily be used via an IFRAME and one line of code
to initialize it. 
<h2>Quick start</h2>
<UL>
	<li>Choose example (below)
	<li>Fill out one or more parameters with their values
	<li>Leave action on 'postTool.asp'
	<li>Click on submit and see what happens.
</ul>
<h2>Handy for web-mail</h2>
Not really, but it's possible. Just go to <a href="http://hotmail.com" target="_new">hotmail.com</a>
Save the startpage on your desktop, change the action-URL to 
http://huizen.dds.nl/~olrik/javascriptman/postTool/postTool.asp.
(download <a href="jsPostTool.asp">JS</a> or <a href="vbPostTool.asp">VBS</a> asp version)
Load this (altered) page in your browser, submit it. At postTool.<strong>asp</strong>, 
you can save the form-values to a cookie (sorry, doesn't
work at the moment).<br><br>
Now, go back to postTool.<strong>htm</strong>: load the cookie and you have a one-button logon.
What people do, to keep themselves busy ;-)
