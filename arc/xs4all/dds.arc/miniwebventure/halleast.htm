Atmosphere description: See the other hall-way.<br>
You almost broke your bones, because there is a <a href="go_down.htm">strairway</a> leading
down. Probably a possible exit of this misery. There's also an <a href="koop.htm">office at the 
south</a>. It seems to be very messy and hot. On the <a href="hallwest.htm">west</a> there's an
other part of the hall-way... Finally, on the north you see a closed door, but it seams to be locked.
