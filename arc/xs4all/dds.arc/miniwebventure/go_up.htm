As you walk up you are noticing that in a fraction of a second, your broken bones are healed. This 
miracle is only possible, because you see a medkit laying here. Probably it's smart to

There's also a banana-skin here, but because of earier experience, you decide not to check
up onto this baby. <br>
The only way you can go now is <a href="halleast.htm">up</a>.
