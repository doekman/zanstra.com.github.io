<FONT COLOR=#FF0000><H2><CENTER><img src="images/zwaailicht.gif"> You are outside <img src="images/flam.gif"></center></h2></font>
You <b>made</b> it... Outside is a nice looking chick with a convertible, who offers you
a hike. You don't think it over, but you hop into the car an of you go...<hr>
This is the end of the game. The more room's you have seen, and the more inventory your
were collecting, the more points you gained. 
<UL><LI>Each room is 10 points, <LI>hidden rooms are 25 point 
(but there aren't any) and <LI>for each inventory-item, add 15 points. <li>You can substract
40 points, if you accidently fell of the stairs</ul>
At the moment for each intentory item 10 points are given instead of 15. But then again, an inventory item
can be picked up multiple times. Fair agina.<br>
There are 12 room's to be visitted (one in two appearances, no extra points) which one with
a hidden exit. Count 30 extra points for this exit (at least if you have taken the shower); 
Further there are 5 object's to pick for your 
inventory. There's one hidden room (1st floor, in the very north-east), but this one can't be 
visited yet...<br><br>
So, the maximum score is <b>195</b> and the minimum points to collect to
get outside is <b>20</b> (6 rooms and falling down... <em>Actually, some people prove, they can
fall down twice in only ONE game, eh Bikkel!</em>).<hr>
See you around next time...
