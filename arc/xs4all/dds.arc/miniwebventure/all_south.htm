<H1><CENTER>Main Office</center></h1>
You are at the south spot of the big office.<br>
There are two desk's here. You decide to take a <a href="nothing.htm" target=examin>closer look</a> 
at the desk next to you.<br><br>
When you look down, you see a typical <b>SSL3</b> Key and Lock. Maybe it's handy, so
if it's not too much trouble, you can <a href="icons/key_lock.htm" target=inv5>pick it up</a>.
You can go <a href="all_middle.htm">north</a> and <a href="kitchen.htm">east</a>.<br>
