<IMG SRC="icons/note.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32 align=right>You pick up the note. It look's a little shabby. Then you realize there
is something written with a blue inkted pen. If you take a closer look, you notice there are
digits written on in two groups. The one you identify as an telephone number (020) 699 22 51. 
The other number you can't identify. It says 1382. But you are curious. You are curious and
you call the phonenumber. It seems it's the number of Randon Security (a part of the Randstad 
Group). So you figure out by yourself, the other number has to be the code of the alarm...<br>
Maybe it's important, so you can <a href="icons/note.htm" target=inv3 >grab the note</a>.
 You also can go <a href="empty.htm" target=examin>back</a>
